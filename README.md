# SecondaryTaskbarClock

Beginning with Windows 8 there is native support to show the taskbar on all connected displays. Unfortunately, the secondary taskbars lack the system clock. This little tool adds the system clock to all secondary taskbars without the need for a skinning engine or custom Windows theme (e.g. Rainmeter).
