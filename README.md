# SecondaryTaskbarClock

Beginning with Windows 8 there is native support to show the taskbar on all connected displays. Unfortunately, the secondary taskbars lack the system clock. This little tool adds the system clock to all secondary taskbars without the need for a skinning engine or custom Windows theme (e.g. Rainmeter).

## Features

- Adds a clock to all secondary taskbars which looks like the default system clock
- Content of the clock (time, date, day of week) depends on taskbar height and regional settings, just as with the native clock
- Clicking a secondary taskbar's clock opens the default calendar flyout on the corresponding secondary display
- Taskbar auto-hide feature is supported
- Long date format tooltip
- When changing size/position of a secondary taskbar the corresponding clock reacts accordingly
- No skin engine or custom theme needed
- No setup needed

## Notes

Currently, the application has only been tested on Windows 10. It should work on Windows 8 but this has yet to be confirmed.
